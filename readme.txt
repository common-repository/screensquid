Record the screen of your website visitors.

== Description ==

ScreenSquid is a website plugin that records everything your visitors do on your website. It’s like having over-the-shoulder user experience videos for every single visitor!

It tracks mouse movements, clicks, typing, scrolls, drags, and page changes. It works on private pages and sites with AJAX or Angular, React, or other frameworks. Recordings show exactly what the user saw and did as they visited your site. It even records mouse hovering, something no other software on planet earth does!

* Understand exactly what your users are doing and help them be successful.
* See how every dollar of an ad campaign was spent with referral tracking.
* Provide better with a full screen recording to go with every support question.
* Discover where visitors get stuck and give up.
* Optimize your site to make more money!

ScreenSquid Desktop is the only desktop session cam in existence. We use a completely original playback mechanism with advantages you’ve never seen before:

* HD playback in an emulated device
* See “hover” states, like when someone hovers over a dropdown menu
* Rendering of Web fonts and SVG
* Support for Angular, React, Ember, and AJAX
* Replays don’t spam Google Analytics tracking
* Jump to specific clicks and form entries with our replay summary
